 now make the gesture apllied to whole screen. right now the user can move the circle ony when tapped and hold which blocks some areas to see. make the circle move from where the user wants, for instance i can control the circle when tapping and holding the bottom area of phone screen and can control the circle just like i can control it now when clicking on it. do not make the mistake to put the circle in the bottom of right corner. it should be in the middle of the page after each game and start so the user controls it from anywhere. for better user friednleness add a long joistic in the bottm of the page that controls the circle
